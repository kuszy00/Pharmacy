<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was made for a classes in which I had to create a web application, so I decided to make online pharmacy store with ASP.NET and React.

### Built With

Backend:

* [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
* [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/ef/)

Frontend:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [MUI](https://mui.com/)

I also use those services APIs and their packages for .NET and Javascript/Typescript:

* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payments services
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for images services
